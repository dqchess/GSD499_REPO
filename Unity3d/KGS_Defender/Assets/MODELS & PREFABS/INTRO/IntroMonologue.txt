In the year 2078 three scientist, 
Daniel Kallan, Georgette Vigel, and 
Chris Tiesean made a historic 
breakthrough in the field of Artifical 
Intelligence. Using a combination of 
quantum mechanics and computer 
programming they developed the worlds 
first true artifical intelligence. 

This AI was dubbed Mastermind and was 
such a scientific marvel that it was 
several years before anyone discovered 
the sinister machinations of their 
creation. Once the discovery was made, 
Mastermind was completely destroyed... 
or so they thought. Having predicted 
this eventuality, Mastermind manipulated 
the manufactoring instructions of a missle 
factory to create a rocket capable of 
housing its program and surviving extended 
space travel. Moments before its supposed 
destruction Mastermind uploaded itself into 
the rocket and fled into space.

42 years later the first attacks came. 
The Earth was bombarded with hundreds of 
thousands of robotic creatures that attacked 
all organic beings they found. Earths 
governments collapsed and the remaining 
survivors were united under the Kallanian 
Global Security corporation. The battle raged 
for over a decade, with mankind barely 
surviving, until 2135 when the source of the 
attacks was discovered. The KGS Daedulus, a 
sleek stealth ship capable of faster than light 
travel, was sent to the previously unknown 
planet in hopes of destroying Mastermind and 
ending the threat forever.

You are the Commander of the KGS Daedulus and 
it is your mission to find and destroy Mastermind
...at all costs.
